## 10/7/2025 - Initial Planning.  

### Overview

I started of with some basic planning.

### What size? 75%

After some research, I liked 75%. Good for gaming and programming.

### What firmware? QMK

This was easy. I wasn't going for a wireless build (more latency), and KMK was unappealing (circuitpy drive). With QMK, I could use VIA/VIAL, which was a win for me.

### What MCU? 

After building two mechanical keyboards, (one for me, one for my sister), both with a separate devboard, I realized that it created too much wasted space. Plus, it didn't fit with my goal of making a crisp, polished keyboard. For this, I could've used a ATmega32u4, a STM32, a nRF52840, or a RP2040. I chose the RP2040, since its easy to use, and supports QMK. The final product will have the RP2040 directly on the PCB, rather than having a separate Pico board.

### Switches

After trying a tactile switch in Undercity, I really want to use them. I won't limit myself, though, since I'll make it hotswappable.

### RGB

After some decision making, I'll either do per-key rgb, with shine through keycaps, or a ring around the keyboard in which the rgb shines through.

### Final Drawing

I decided to create a mock up for the final product.

I couldn't get a knob going in KLE, so I just labelled it vol.

This is a very crude drawing of a cross section
  

## 10/8/2025 - Set up RP2040 in Schematics  

Nothing much, followed the guide from blueprint to give the necessary components for the RP2040 in the schematics, nothing else.

I also went over the official hardware design document to see if I missed anything. Overall, it wasn't much work, 1 hour at most. 

Final Schematic:
